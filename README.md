# üéìüéì Apache Cassandra¬Æ Data Modelling

Welcome to the **Apache Cassandra¬Æ Data Modelling** workshop! In this two-hour workshop, we show the methodology to build an effective data model with the distributed `NoSQL database Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢`.

Using **Astra DB**, the cloud based _Cassandra-as-a-Service_ platform delivered by DataStax, we will cover the process for every developer who wants to build an application: list the use cases and build an effective data model.

<p/>
<details>
<summary><b> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Can I run this workshop on my computer?</b></summary>
<hr>
<p>There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine. If you do so, you will need the following:
<ol>
<li><b>git</b> installed on your local system
</ol>
</p>
In this readme, we try to provide instructions for local development as well - but keep in mind that the main focus is development on Gitpod, hence <strong>we can't guarantee live support</strong> about local development in order to keep on track with the schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to succeed.

<summary><b> 2Ô∏è‚É£ What other prerequisites are required?</b></summary>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>You will need enough "real estate" on screen, we will ask you to open a few windows and it would not fit on mobiles (tablets should be OK)
<li>You will need an Astra account: don't worry, we'll work through that in the following
<li>As "Intermediate level" we expect you to know what java and Spring are.

# üèÅ Start Hands-on

## 4. Create Your Astra DB Instance

_**`ASTRA DB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, 40M read/write operations and about 80GB storage monthly for free - sufficient to run small production workloads. If you end your credits the databases will pause, no charge_

Leveraging [Database creation guide](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-instance/#c-procedure) create a database. *Right-Click the button* with *Open in a new TAB.*

<a href="https://astra.dev/yt-7-27"><img src="images/create_astra_db_button.png?raw=true" /></a>

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Database Name**| `workshops`|
|**Keyspace Name**| `sensor_data`|
|**Regions**| Select `GOOGLE CLOUD`, then an Area close to you, then a region with no LOCKER üîí icons, those are the region you can use for free.   |

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:** If you already have a database `workshops`, simply add a keyspace `sensor_data` using the `Add Keyspace` button on the bottom right hand corner of db dashboard page.

While the database is being created, you will also get a **Security token**:
save it somewhere safe, as it will be needed to later in other workshops (In particular the string starting with `AstraCS:...`.)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**
> ```
> The instructor will show you on screen how to create a token
> but will have to destroy to token immediately for security reasons.
> ```

The status will change from `Pending` to `Active` when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

## 6. Dynamic Bucketing

<details>
  <summary> <h3>üìå Homework 1</h3></summary>

Consider the table that supports query `Find all sensors in a specified network`:
```sql
CREATE TABLE sensors_by_network_2 (
  network TEXT,
  sensor TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY ((network), sensor)
);
```

Assume that a network may have none to millions of sensors. With dynamic bucketing, we can introduce artificial buckets to store sensors. A network with a few sensors may only need one bucket. A network with many sensors may need many buckets. Once buckets belonging to a particular network get filled with sensors, we can dynamically assign new buckets to store new sensors of this network.

üìò **Implement dynamic bucketing in Astra DB**
```sql
-- Table to manage buckets
CREATE TABLE buckets_by_network (
  network TEXT,
  bucket TIMEUUID,
  PRIMARY KEY ((network), bucket)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (bucket DESC);

-- Table to store sensors
CREATE TABLE sensors_by_bucket (
  bucket TIMEUUID,
  sensor TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY ((bucket), sensor)
);


-- Sample data
INSERT INTO buckets_by_network (network, bucket) VALUES ('forest-net', 49171ffe-0d12-11ed-861d-0242ac120002);
INSERT INTO buckets_by_network (network, bucket) VALUES ('forest-net', 74a13ede-0d12-11ed-861d-0242ac120002);

INSERT INTO sensors_by_bucket (bucket, sensor) VALUES (49171ffe-0d12-11ed-861d-0242ac120002, 's1001');
INSERT INTO sensors_by_bucket (bucket, sensor) VALUES (49171ffe-0d12-11ed-861d-0242ac120002, 's1002');

INSERT INTO sensors_by_bucket (bucket, sensor) VALUES (74a13ede-0d12-11ed-861d-0242ac120002, 's1003');
```

üìò **Add a new sensor to a network**

1. Get the latest bucket.
```sql
SELECT bucket FROM buckets_by_network WHERE network = 'forest-net' LIMIT 1;
```

2. Check the number of sensors in the bucket.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS sensors
FROM sensors_by_bucket WHERE bucket = 74a13ede-0d12-11ed-861d-0242ac120002;
```

3. Depending on the sensors-per-bucket threshold, insert a new sensor into the existing bucket, or create a new bucket and insert into the new bucket.
```sql
INSERT INTO sensors_by_bucket (bucket, sensor) VALUES (74a13ede-0d12-11ed-861d-0242ac120002, 's1004');
```

üìò **Retrieve sensors in a specified network**

1. Retrieve the buckets
```sql
SELECT bucket FROM buckets_by_network WHERE network = 'forest-net';
```

2. Retrieve the sensors
```sql
SELECT sensor
FROM sensors_by_bucket
WHERE bucket IN (74a13ede-0d12-11ed-861d-0242ac120002, 49171ffe-0d12-11ed-861d-0242ac120002);
```
